**Example:**

[Example Problem]
Question: A bag contains red, blue, and green marbles. There are twice as many blue marbles as red marbles, and three times as many green marbles as blue marbles. If there are 6 red marbles, how many green marbles are there?

Reasoning:
Step 1: Identify the number of blue marbles based on the problem's description. There are twice as many blue marbles as red marbles. Since there are 6 red marbles, there are 6 × 2 = 12 blue marbles.
Result: 12 blue marbles.

Step 2: Identify the number of green marbles based on the problem's description. There are three times as many green marbles as blue marbles. Since there are 12 blue marbles, there are 12 × 3 = 36 green marbles.
Result: 36 green marbles.

Final Verification: The relationships provided in the problem are consistent with the calculations. There are twice as many blue marbles as red marbles and three times as many green marbles as blue marbles.

Answer: 36
